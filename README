All files required to make simgen are contained in this directory.
The default driver (and its helpers) is an empty C++ shell and it 
is recommended that customised driver routines are created in separate 
directories elsewhere.

The user manual is in the sub-directory doc and the API is specified
as comments in the utility files: cell.hpp  data.hpp  geom.hpp  Mat.hpp  
Seg.hpp  util.hpp  Vec.hpp

Most test application directories have informative names and in each
there is usually a tcsh script to run the program otherwise try:
simgen somefile.run 

NB: I forgot to mention the interactive controls. JKL = rot.XYZ and XYZ
for translation. (Z trans = zoom). Each is reversed in lower-case. For 
rotation, these are velocity increments and Q sets them back to zero.  
ESC = quit.
